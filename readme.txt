### We poured over 27&#160;000 hours of love into this plugin. <br>Here are the results:

* **It is brilliant.**
The SEO Framework is an [expert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system) for SEO. It is the only solution that can intelligently generate critical SEO meta tags in any language by reading your WordPress environment. This automation saves you a considerable amount of time that could be used to write more content or focus on other tasks. It also removes the need for advanced SEO knowledge.

* **It comes preconfigured.**
With The SEO Framework, we provide an excellent starting point for your website by rationally optimizing all your pages. Naturally, you can also tweak it however you like. If you're not an SEO expert, learn what you may wish to optimize in our [Setup guide](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2428).

* **It helps you optimize your metadata.**
We made the only SEO plugin that follows Google's webmaster guidelines to the letter. It took years of research and tweaking to translate this well inside your WordPress interface. Finally, you can freely optimize your pages without having to worry about making critical mistakes.

* **It creates a beautiful overview.**
On your post overview pages, you'll find color-coded guidelines. They suggest how to improve your pages as you hover over them with your mouse cursor. For example, when your titles are unbranded or when WordPress blocks indexing. Instinctively, touch-and keyboard navigation is also supported.

* **It includes exceptional support.**
We don't outsource our support. We're here for you. Feel free to drop by [our support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription/) at any time to ask a question. More than 1400 inquiries have been answered personally, typically within 48 hours in the past five years.

* **It leaves no room for errors.**
We focus on the quality of features you need over the quantity on features you don't. This trait makes this plugin unique, faster, more accurate, nearly bug-free, and more sustainable. The added benefit is that your site is unlikely to get penalized by search engines. We won't steer you into writing unnatural content or allow you to trick search engines.

* **It remains genuine and pure.**
We built The SEO Framework for small to large corporations and enterprises. The interface is entirely accessible and seamlessly integrates within your dashboard. Therefore, interacting with this plugin feels natural. It might feel dull, but your WordPress dashboard shouldn't be a billboard for our branding. We won't ever change this.

* **It improves search presence.**
The SEO Framework ranks your website distinctively by enabling breadcrumbs for Google Search via structured data. It also automatically generates titles and descriptions according to Google's guidelines and quickly helps search engines find the website's latest changes via the built-in optimized sitemap.

* **It makes social sharing easy.**
The SEO Framework automatically supports and allows you to further tailor the Open Graph, Facebook, and Twitter Cards protocols. It helps your posts stand out when they're shared on various social networks, including Pinterest, Discord, and WhatsApp.

* **It feels more than accessible.**
We handpicked our color scheme so that people with any medically recognized color-vision deficiency can distinguish the guidelines set by search engines. We also implemented full keyboard-navigation and screen-reader support.

* **It protects you from mistakes.**
The SEO Framework steers you from making significant and common SEO mistakes. It leaves little room for you to mess up because the plugin already does everything SEO for you. For example, it automatically prevents duplicated content mistakes by enforcing strict canonical rules.

* **It follows best-practices and beyond.**
The biggest problems with WordPress plugins are security and compatibility. As part-time security researchers, we focus on making this plugin impenetrable. The SEO Framework also uses WordPress's API whenever possible, making this plugin integrate neatly with every other plugin written with that in mind.

* **It has developers at heart.**
We encourage other developers to enhance and add functionality to this plugin. We've done so ourselves, already, with our [extensions](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/). Check out [our API](https://theseoframework.com/?p=82), and feel free to [contribute](https://tsf.fyi/contributing)!

* **It respects your privacy.**
The SEO Framework sends us no information and does not create cookies. Learn more from our strictly adhered-to [privacy policy](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1701#pluginprivacyinformation).

### Unbranded, free and for the professionals

The SEO Framework is a uniquely white label plugin that blends seamlessly into your WordPress dashboard. This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within your WordPress interface. No ads, no nags. Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your website. Note that we output standardized development-comments distinguishing the plugin output in source code. You can remove these with our free [Incognito extension](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2301).

### Behind the screens

The SEO Framework works on many things without notifying you, because the best software is fast, nimble, responsive, and should save you precious time. Here are a few things it does behind the screens.

* It prevents canonical errors for categories, pages, subdomains, and WordPress Multisite domain mapping.
* It stops SEO attacks that are caused by pagination exploits in WordPress by telling the search engine to look at the existing last page instead.
* It discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even when they don't send a 404 response.
* It automatically notifies Google and the Bing network on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.
* It discourages search engines from indexing feeds and the sitemap. This doesn't mean they won't use them; only, they won't show them in their search results.
* It directs search engines from the comment pages back to the post storing those comments.

### Compatibility

**The SEO Framework supports:**

* Internationalization through WordPress.org. You can [contribute here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/autodescription/).
* Unicode (UTF-8) character recognition and rendering, including Emoji and CJKV (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese).
* Right to Left (RTL) languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, etc.), through its interface and metatag generation.
* Complete color-vision deficiency accessibility thanks to a carefully picked color scheme.
* Full keyboard navigation, so that you can inspect tooltips quickly without ever having to reach for your mouse.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads, tracking, bloat, or nags!
This plugin is slim yet all-inclusive. It's 100% freeware, not crippleware.

= Is there a premium version? =

No. We treat this plugin as a premium plugin already.

However, we do offer many free and paid extensions that help support this free plugin. We provide these via our free [Extension Manager plugin](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760).

= Why is there no analytics, tracking, or 404 monitoring? =

SEO experts that use advanced tools such as Ahrefs, SEMrush, Screaming Frog, and Google Analytics prefer using The SEO Framework because it doesn't try to do their job haphazardly.

To correctly analyze your website, it must be done from the outside. If we load these features on your site, bad robots will cause thousands of false positives that fill your database with useless information that doesn't apply to search engines. We refrain from this because it won't ever help you anyway.

= I have a feature request, a question, or found a bug. =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell us about it.

We'll try to get back to you within a week. Typically, we reply within three days.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

Any input is much appreciated, and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

Learn more [about contributing](https://tsf.fyi/contributing).

= What do the colors tell me? =

We use different colors to convey messages. Red is an error that you must resolve. Yellow is a non-critical warning that you may want to address. Green is good. Blue is informational and situational. Gray is undefined or unprocessable.

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, etc. =

Not having every single page listed is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.

If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a search engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

Check out our [Extension Manager](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760). It brings extensions, like [Articles](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2303), that fill in the gaps via modern and more robust means.

= The sitemap contains unwanted links. =

The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.

If you don't want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the `noindex` option for it. This option will also remove the page from search engine result pages.

If the link shouldn't be in the sitemap because it's meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.
You should tell the author to check out the "`public` and `rewrite` post type arguments." The plugin or theme author should know what that means.

In the meantime, you can disable SEO for the unwanted entries via the "General SEO Settings" under "Exclusions."

= Why aren't focus keywords included? =

[Google warns](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/irrelevant-keywords) about the keyword stuffing approach implemented by some other SEO plugins. It forces users to write unnatural content, and it can have adverse effects on your site's ranking.

Modern search engines use AI to understand the context of your articles. This means that as long as you write relevant content, you shouldn't have to worry about keywords.

However, we implemented the same API Google uses to help you find appropriate synonyms and inflections for your keywords. This functionality is part of our premium suite of extensions.

= What do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers that tell search engines how to connect and index the site. We do this via the Schema.org standard.

They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, which social sites you're connected to, and what page structure you're using. This is also referred to as **structured data**.

= How do I display breadcrumbs? =

The SEO Framework outputs hidden breadcrumbs for search engines to find via its Schema.org settings.

You can also output these breadcrumbs visually in your theme by [using a shortcode](https://kb.theseoframework.com/?p=212).

== Changelog ==

TODO In Polylang 3.5.x (and 3.6), unsetting " Hide URL language information for default language" will cause the robots.txt URLs to add extraneous language prefixes. The sitemap endpoints still work on their correct URL, however.
	-> It's also incorrect if the homepage URL isn't of the DEFAULT language. Still, that causes the site to malfunction altogether.
		-> What homepage URL?
	-> https://wordpress.org/support/topic/issue-with-xml-sitemap-generation-in-non-english-languages-polylang/
	-> UNRELATED but similar: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/sitemap-issue-with-polylang/

TODO In Polylang 3.5 or 3.6, they reversed the order of columns (another bug) when using quick-edit. _defunct_badly_coded_polylang_script() still addresses the disappearance of TSF's data, but they bork it in PHP this time.

TODO add cornerstone as a non-html page builder.

TODO disable Avada's SEO settings.

TODO when double-clicking the submit button, we process the settings submission twice.
	-> The second time it'll state nothing has changed, and this is what the user then sees.

TODO new translations are available.
TODO add that TSF is an independent project that doesn't need to hit profit margins; ergo, it's made for the benefit of its users, not the creator.

TODO https://wordpress.org/support/topic/about-homepage-meta-description-with-wpml/#post-17715796?
	-> Also note the KB article mention which we need to address.

TODO: expand WPML string translation for TSF metadata
	-> See https://wordpress.org/support/topic/about-homepage-meta-description-with-wpml/#post-17715796.
	-> DONE: Also consider adding PTA settings, though these are dynamic
		-> Figure how we can implement this.
	-> TODO: Report this to the KB
		-> Also consider explaining how to translate settings (checkboxes from 1 to 0, etc.)
			<ol><li>Go to "WPML > String Translation."</li>
				<li>Scroll down, select "Translate texts in admin screens."</li>
				<li>Search for "autodescription," and select the Options you want to translate.</li>
				<li>Hit "Add to String Translation."</li>
				<li>Return to "WPML > String Translation."</li>
				<li>Now, you should see the selected option under Name (note: might be on the second page).</li>
				<li>Hit the big plus under the other languages to set a custom value.</li>
				<li>Click anywhere on the page to save your translation.</li></ol>
		-> Note common values (-1 force index, 0 index, 1 noindex, 1 checked, 0 unchecked)
	-> TODO: https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/185#issuecomment-2097836954

TODO translatepress multilingual sitemap? Is this possible? See backlogged emails with them.

TODO validate the URL field before showing an image preview?

TODO when zooming in on iOS, the touch registration no longer aligns with the tooltip arrow.
	-> This will probably involve some annoying relative offset vs screen width maths.

TODO jr dot nl/?calendar=$test doesn't invoke aqp?
	-> Probably some other plugin mangles the request before AQP touches it.
		-> Ask for list of plugins?

TODO introduce css --vars
	-> Applying colors would be a nice starting point.

TODO add TikTok social profile hint? eh...
	-> Also, there appears to be a specific format: https://support.google.com/business/answer/13580646.

TODO regression: the "popular categories" are no longer listened for changes.
	-> This is an issue with WP 6.7???

TODO remove HTML4 closers in admin? It's definitly 5.
	-> Also remove HTML4 support on the front-end? How many themes are still using 4?

TODO the correct indentation for comments seems to be 4 per tab (+1 initial)

TODO LinkedIn Post Inspector recommends the "Author" tag, which is often ambiguously described. We could opt-in this feature via the Social Sharing settings, stating that LinkedIn uses it.

TODO add ignore for Asgaros forums. See https://wordpress.org/support/topic/canonical-on-forum/.

TODO enqueueUnregisteredInputTrigger -> alias enqueueTriggerUnregisteredInput
	- The latter has a better relation with the other method's name.

TODO patch WP Core bug https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51912 using https://wp-kama.com/handbook/sitemap/bag-404-pagination.
	-> We can probably mend this inside the generator.
	-> Report back to user: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/sitemap-404-error-15/.

TODO check if bbPress/BuddyPress needs breadcrumb support?

TODO the title prefix doesn't appear to work in quick-edit for Terms.

TODO write https://kb.theseoframework.com/?p=256#default-blocklist-ai and https://kb.theseoframework.com/?p=256#default-blocklist-seo

TODO do we consider multiple taxonomies for a single post type?
	* See email from Damien. -> We can test this with ACF Pro.

TODO add Bricks Templates to exclusions like we did for Elementor (they are not publicly accessible...)
	-> Post Type: bricks_template
	-> Taxonomy: template_tag, template_bundle

TODO rename "Twitter Profile"
	-> Also update TSF links on main site accordingly.

TODO we updated Babel, we need to reparse all scripts to prevent discrepancies.

Punt:
- remove jQuery dependencies in UI?
- The image placeholder is not considering of the featured image in WP 6.6 Gutenberg.
	-> It does update on Save.
	-> Also affects Classic Editor, but perhaps we never implemented something like this.

### 5.1.0 - Hope

**For everyone:**

* **Upgraded:** Now uses TSF database version `5100`
	* Two new options are available: `robotstxt_block_ai` and `robotstxt_block_seo`.
* **Added:**
	* We introduce our bespoke Canonical URL Notation Tool, allowing TSF to dynamically update the example canonical URL when editing a page or term, either via their edit screens, or via quick-edit.
		* It listens to many changes of the editor that could influence the URL, depending on your site's permalink settings.
			* Among these, are `%year%`, `%monthnum%`, `%day%`, `%hour%`, `%minute%`, `%second%`, `%post_id%`, `%postname%`, `%category%`, and `%author%`.
				* `%pagename%` is treated as `%postname%` internally. You should never make this part of the permalink structure, anyway.
			* It also works for custom post types and taxonomies, such as those created by WooCommerce and bbPress.
				* TODO it works with all of bbPress but the Forum pages. What's up with that?
			* This system dynamically fetches page ancestor, author, and term slugs as needed. These are then cached in the browser. This dynamic fetching may appear as a delay in writing the canonical URL when making changes.
			* Please note that you should never use `%pagename%` in your permalink structure. `%postname%` gets transformed to `%pagename%` automatically when needed.
	* You can now block crawlers like AI language model trainers and SEO analysis from using your content via the "Robots Settings."
	* You can now specify a redirect URL for the homepage.
		* If the homepage is a page, this will take precedence over the page's metadata redirect URL.
	* You can now specify a canonical URL for the homepage.
		* If the homepage is a page, this will take precedence over the page's metadata canonical URL.
	* You'll now be informed when an image type isn't compatible with most social platforms. This is displayed next to the image preview icon.
		* Also, the preview icon no longer shows when the image cannot be loaded. You'll now see an error message instead.
	* For WPML Multilingual Plugin, the following fields are automatically registered with their String Translation tool under domain `admin_texts_autodescription-site-settings`. Please note that these are only shown when they have a value inputted via the SEO Settings page:
		* **Homepage:** title, description, social image URL, Open Graph title and description, Twitter title and description.
			* Identifyable by name `[autodescription-site-settings]homepage_*`.
		* **Post Type Archive:** title, description, social image URL, canonical URL, redirect URL, Open Graph title and description, Twitter title and description.
			* Identifyable by name `[autodescription-site-settings][pta][<post_type_name>]*`.
* **Improved:**
	* References to X and Twitter Card are more distinctive now.
	* Description, title, and canonical URL input placeholders now blur on focus with Quick Edit.
	* The image selection button and preview icon animations are now twice as fast.
	* The input placeholder blurring animation is now twice as fast.
		* Note that [Firefox still doesn't support animations for placeholders](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1115623). Now, we could workaround this using animations instead of transitions, but that's another can of worms.
	* The Canonical URL input field's placeholder now blurs on focus (Quick Edit, Post Edit, Term Edit, SEO Settings).
	* The plugin now better conveys where to modify the homepage's title "additions."
	* The canonical URL placeholder is now populated for Quick Edit.
		* Please note that it doesn't respond to category changes, because we still need to find a good way to implement primary term selection here. So, it assumes the category selection as it was when the Quick Edit was opened. For more details, [see issue 512](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/512).
	* After saving a page in the Block Editor, the SEO Bar (if displayed) fades in much quicker now.
	* The SEO Bar symbols have a tad more contrast now due to a darker text shadow, improving legibility (primarily for a yellow item).
	* Floating title parts (e.g., `Protected: ` or your site title) have been offset by half a character on overflow, so that their text won't stick to your input.
	* Floating title parts now also disappear when there are fewer than 1.33 characters are visible, so that they won't overlap your input.
	* Reduced the admin stylesheet payload by implementing modern logical declarations.
	* Reduced the sitemap stylesheet size by also implementing modern logical declarations for that.
	* The SEO meta box tab labels are now inline when there's enough space.
	* The quick-edit default indexing state now updates to the post password or private status accordingly.
	* The Block Editor on WP 6.7 proposes a new layout for their select fields, which we've opted in for with the Primary Term selection.
	* If a settings listeners fails for any reason, other listeners may still continue. Leaving you with a semi-broken interface, instead of completely broken. For example, if the code crosses and unexpected value for the Homepage title input, only its character counters will be borked, but you can still upload an image for social sharing.
		* This works for the Settings, Post Edit, Term Edit, and List Edit pages.
		* This is a targeted fail-safe and won't work everywhere all the time.
* **Changed:**
	* WordPress 5.7 brought us a new higher contrast color palette. We found our color scheme matching their colors well, but now think it better to implement those colors into TSF. Notably, you'll find that the SEO Bar is darker and easier on the eyes. The pixel and character counters appear more vigorous.
		* We didn't copy WordPress's colors one-to-one. At times, we found the yellow too dull, and made it more vibrant.
	* The Primary Term selector for the Classic Editor has been rewritten for accessibility, performance, and accuracy. We didn't spend time modernizing this before because we thought Classic Editor would've been phased out.
		* Note that the Primary Term selector is no longer a button, but a dropdown selection field, placed dynamically beneath the term selection checkboxes. This mimics the behavior we have for the Block Editor, simultaneously resolving some z-fighting issues we had with some languages for the tooltip placement.
	* The "Robots Meta Settings" are now called "Robots Settings" because we added a tab for AI blocking via Robots.txt (when available).
	* The "Robots" meta settings for the homepage is now called "Visibility" settings, because it now includes Canonical URL and Redirect URL input fields.
* **Fixed:**
	* Resolved an issue where comment pagination queries were only ignored after the main query when the Full Site Editor was present; now, they're always ignored.
	* Resolved a regression where the post-saving sequence wasn't properly debounced, causing multiple save-state requests for TSF's meta box that affected the Block Editor's performance performance and caused the SEO settings UI to flicker.
	* Awesome Motive's All in One SEO Pack plugin outputs a notice urging to deactivate other SEO plugins, but without clarifying which SEO plugin emits this notice or telling which plugins get deactivated. So, we now hide this deceptive notice.
	* Resolved a regression from WordPress 6.6 where a CSS identifier disappeared. We used this identifier to apply styling for the sidebar. We now use a different, more specific identifier that's in all WordPress versions we support; from `.edit-post-sidebar`, now `#edit-post\:document`.
	* Resolved an issue where the counter AJAX spinner wasn't offset by 3 pixels from the character counter's loader text. It's now also changed to 0.5 character widths.
	* Resolved a typo causing the description placeholders to not blur on focus on the SEO Settings page when using Firefox.
	* Resolved an issue where the Classic Editor's Primary Term selection label's cursor wasn't a pointer in WP 6.5 and later.
	* Resolved an issue where horizontal scrolling bars would appear when the inputted title is wider than the screen when measured from the container.
	* Resolved a long-standing regression where WordPress 5.3 changed the checkbox mark from a colorable item to an immutable image, so it was no longer green or red colored for The SEO Framework's default and warned settings, respectively. Thanks to this fix, Firefox is now also fully supported (it doesn't natively support checkbox colors), although it might be more demanding of your device to render the checkboxes.
		* It took so long because we needed esoteric CSS that glitches when its container animates, namely, `mix-blend-mode`. We found a workaround with some trial and error.
	* Resolved an issue where resetting the settings twice in a row would result in an "unknown error." Now, you get a "No SEO settings were changed" message instead.
	* Resolved an issue where the floating title parts didn't align properly when dealing with subpixel alignment.
	* Resolved an issue where the floating title parts repositioned or (un)trimmed only when passing the `782px` screen width boundary, while they ought to be recalculated with every screen size change.
	* Resolved an issue where the floating title prefix (e.g., `Private: `) didn't trim when the site title was removed.
	* When setting '0' as a password via quick-edit, WordPress actually doesn't consider it a valid password. So, TSF now won't reflect this via its quick-edit interface either.
		* We already considered this behavior for the Classic and Block editor.
	* An "Are you sure?" notice is now emitted when leaving the page without saving after the Primary Term is changed on Classic Editor.
* **Notes:**
	* WordPress 6.0 is now required, from 5.9. This allowed us to drop legacy Gutenberg support.

**For translators:**

* TODO

**For developers:**

* **PHP API notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* Method `tsf()->image()->generate_custom_image_details_from_query()` is now public.
		* Method `tsf()->image()->generate_custom_image_details_from_args()` is now public.
		* Method `tsf()->format()->arrays()->array_diff_assoc_recursive()` is now available. It's the first of its kind that supports more than two array inputs.
		* Method `tsf()->description()->excerpt()->get_excerpt()` is now available. It's an alias of `get_post_excerpt()`, which is marked for deprecation due to being mislabeled.
		* Method `tsf()->data()->user()->get_userdata()` is now available. It's an alias of WordPress's `get_userdata()`, but with proper memoization for improved performance.
	* **Changed:**
		* `The_SEO_Framework\Data\Plugin\Post::get_meta()` (`tsf()->data()->plugin()->post()->get_meta()`) now returns the default meta if the post type isn't supported.
		* `The_SEO_Framework\Data\Plugin\PTA::get_meta()` (`tsf()->data()->plugin()->pta()->get_meta()`) now returns the default meta if the PTA isn't supported.
		* `The_SEO_Framework\Data\Plugin\Term::get_meta()` (`tsf()->data()->plugin()->term()->get_meta()`) now returns the default meta if the term's taxonomy isn't supported.
		* `The_SEO_Framework\Data\Plugin\User::get_meta()` (`tsf()->data()->plugin()->user()->get_meta()`) now returns the default meta if the user ID is empty.
		* `The_SEO_Framework\Data\Plugin::update_option()` (`tsf()->data()->plugin()->update_option()`) no longer considers headlessness. The headless filters are ought to stay in place throughout the request, affecting `get_option()`.
	* **Removed:**
		* Vestigal pool `tsf()->data()->plugin()->home()` is now gone, its object was provisioned but never published.
			* It may come back one day, but we have no plans for that just yet.
	* **Fixed:**
		* Resolved an issue where the deprecated method `tsf()->og_locale()` didn't return the meta tag and gave a warning instead.
		* `tsf()->fetch_locale()` is now properly deprecated and returns its original value.
			* Its first parameter has been removed and now always uses the current locale.
			* Use `tsf()->open_graph()->get_locale()` instead.
		* `tsf()->schema()->entities` now report the correct class names.
		* TODO  Resolved an issue where `tsf()->filter()->escape()->xml_uri()` would emit a PHP deprecation notice when a query parameter was present in the URL.
		* The `schema.org/WebPage` type reference is resetted now when regenerated.
		* When switching blogs on multisite, all data memoization for TSF's options and site cache now actually flush via trait `The_SEO_Framework\Traits\Property_Refresher`.
			* Due to a name change of properties during development, this was accidentally disabled.
			* This did work as intended for default options.
			* This feature resolves edge-cases we have yet to encounter, but it could affect post filtering when fetching data from a different blog inside a network.
			* We also added PTA, Post, Term, and User settings to the refresher, which were previously omitted for performance reasons, which we've now mitigated.
* **JavaScript API notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* JS Event `tsf-updated-block-editor` is now available.
		* JS Event `tsf-updated-block-editor-${type}` is now available.
		* JS Event `tsf-updated-primary-term` is now available.
		* JS file `utils.js` is now available and considered "common"; it contains two public methods: `debounce` and `delay`.
		* JS file `ui.js` is now available and considered "common"; it handles notices and contains two public methods: `fadeIn`, `fadeOut`, and `traceAnimation`.
		* JS file `termSlugs.js` is now available and loaded with `post.js`, `term.js`, and `le.js`; it handles term selections to update the canonical URLs accordingly. It has an advanced caching system to prevent repeated lookups. The initial lookup is done via PHP, and they're only done when the permalink structure requests it it (`%category%`, `%product_cat%`, etc.).
		* JS file `authorSlugs.js` is now available and loaded with `post.js` and `le.js`; it handles author selections to update the canonical URLs accordingly. It has a caching system to prevent repeated lookups. The initial lookup is done via PHP, and they're only done when the permalink structure requires it (`%author%`).
		* jQuery Event `tsf-updated-gutenberg-${type}` now also respond to `'slug'` type changes.
			* But this event is deprecated. Use the JS Event `tsf-updated-block-editor-${type}` instead.
		* `tsfTerm.taxonomy` is now available.
	* **Improved:**
		* JS Events `tsf-updated-block-editor` and `tsf-updated-block-editor-${type}` now respond to `'slug'` type changes.
		* Removed redundant lookups and processing in quick-edit by testing if we're editing a post or taxonomy.
		* Updating the Post's password in the Classic Editor no longer triggers 3 updates sequentially.
	* **Changed:**
		* We now use functions instead of constant-arrow-functions in our JS code. This makes imlpementing utilities, such as debouncers, easier, thanks to function hoisting.
			* With that, for all affected functions, we removed `@function` JSDoc annotation, since that's now redundant.
		* `tsf.selectByValue()` now also tries to select by label, which is tried together with the content.
	* **Deprecated:**
		* jQuery event `tsf-updated-gutenberg-${type}` is now deprecated. Use JS Event `tsf-updated-block-editor-${type}` instead.
		* `tsf.ampHTMLtoText()` is now deprecated, with no alternative available.
		* `tsfAys.getChangedState()` is now deprecated. Use `tsfAys.areSettingsChanged()` instead.
* **Option notes:**
	* Of option `autodescription-site-settings` (constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SITE_OPTIONS`, pool `tsf()->data()->plugin()`, or legacy API `tsf()->get_options()`):
		* Added index `robotstxt_block_ai`. Default 0.
		* Added index `robotstxt_block_seo`. Default 0.
		* Added index `homepage_redirect`. Default empty.
		* Added index `homepage_canonical`. Default empty.
	* We're now stipulant about the autoloading status of every option by setting `update_option()`'s third parameter. This is because WordPress 6.6 makes up its own mind on the autoloading state based on arbitrary and untested values. Although that shouldn't affect TSF's options directly, one could filter it so it could become our problem. The distinct annotation of always autoloading (and toggling that when the plugin (de)activates) will ensure TSF always performs as intended.
* **Action notes:**
	* **Changed:**
		* `the_seo_framework_flex_tab_content`, now uses `'args'` instead of `'params'` for its first parameter's indexes.
			* I didn't deprecate this because I don't think anyone uses it.
* **Filter notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* `the_seo_framework_schema_queued_graph_data` is now available. It's used to allow creating graph references.
		* `the_seo_framework_robots` is now available. It's used to create a map of robots directives to generate.
			* In effect, `the_seo_framework_robots_txt_pre` and `the_seo_framework_robots_txt_pro` are deprecated.
		* `the_seo_framework_get_excerpt` is now available. It's used to get an excerpt, used before parsing the entire post content, for description generation.
	* **Deprecated:**
		* `the_seo_framework_robots_disallow_queries`, use `the_seo_framework_robots` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_robots_txt_pre`, use `the_seo_framework_robots` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_robots_txt_pro`, use `the_seo_framework_robots` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_generated_archive_excerpt`, use `the_seo_framework_get_excerpt` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_pta_description_excerpt`, use `the_seo_framework_get_excerpt` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_fallback_archive_description_excerpt`, use `the_seo_framework_get_excerpt` instead.
* **Improved:**
	* Improved the Markdown parser's performance by using fewer memory operations.
	* Removed the jQuery dependency for scripts `tsf`, `tsf-post`, and `tsf-media` by refactoring animations to vanilla JS and CSS.
	* Added the Dashicons depdency for scripts `tsf`, `tsf-ui` (new), and `tsf-settings` because it appears this may be unregistered as a default WordPress admin stylesheet.
* **Other:**
	* Element `.tsf-notice-wrap` is gone. We've long been relying on `.wp-header-end` instead.
	* Removed support for obsolete `-ms-clear` and `-ms-input-placeholder` vendor-specific CSS pseudo-selectors.
	* CSS file `tsf-media` is now available and will be loaded alongside its namesake script.
	* We optimized opcodes for PHP 8.4:
		* In short, PHP 8.4's OPcache module now also precaches `sprintf`. But, when working inside a namespace, we can only utilize that by namespace-escaping calls to `sprintf`.
		* We maintain static code checks for this via [WPCS-TSF](https://github.com/theseoframework/wpcs-tsf).

### 5.0.6

This patch addresses an issue where [WordPress 6.0 and higher mistakenly tweaks unpaginated queries as comment-paginated](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/60806), causing indexing issues when using Full Site Editing or themes that [prerender Blocks before TSF](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4244).

### 5.0.5

In this minor sitemap-centric update, we've integrated WPML and Polylang's language-specific sitemap URLs into robots.txt, clarified support for complex sitemaps, and removed deprecated pinging functionality. We also added seconds to timestamps, resolved issues pertaining to the number 0, and remotely [fixed another compatibility issue in Polylang](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4234).

### 5.0.4

This tiny update [addresses an issue](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4215) that affected detection of the assigned blog page.

### 5.0.3

This minor update fixes compatibility with Polylang Pro. We also perfected the detection of unassigned home and blog pages and improved the Block Editor's load time by [resolving a glitch](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4204).

### 5.0.2

This minor update fixes more issues our community found after the release of TSF v5.0.0. We also improved the calculation of primary terms with child terms and how breadcrumbs handle post type archives. And again, we [improved the performance](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4174).

### 5.0.1

This minor update fixes issues our community found after the release of TSF v5.0.0. We also [improved the performance](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4158).

### 5.0.0 - Apex

*We become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts. - [Aristotle](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3Dpos%3D17%3Asection%3D4)*

**Release highlights**

* There's a brand-new relational Schema.org structured data generator.
* We added a new shortcode (and function) for breadcrumbs to put in your templates.
* You can now select a preferred Twitter Card type for every post, term, and custom post type.
* Do you fancy the SEO Bar but find it distracting? Toggle the new dull, low-contrast color scheme.
* Special characters are now normalized for SEO Bar assertions, so it is now far more accurate.
* Users with an author role anywhere in a multisite network can now have their SEO meta tweaked from any site.
* Tooltip backgrounds and various border accents now adhere to the admin color scheme (once more).

**Apex**

Even though we dubbed TSF v4.2 "perfect," it couldn't be even better because of its legacy codebase. Many features and tweaks weren't possible because those would've created bugs or made maintenance impossible. In v5.0, we overhauled everything while keeping in mind the future. In doing so, we managed to ascend to a new apex, and we can now see the next summit ahead.

Its code is unrecognizable, yet somehow very familiar. TSF v5.0 "Apex" is just the beginning of what comes next, and it won't be downhill from here.

**New breadcrumb shortcode**

You can now use shortcode `&#91;tsf_breadcrumb&#93;`. This shortcode is meant to be implemented in your theme and will output the current breadcrumb. It will listen to your meta title settings. You can learn more about its syntax in our [Knowledge Base about the Breadcrumb shortcode](https://tsf.fyi/kb/a/212).

**Important for developers**

* We refactored the entire codebase in this update -- over 1.20 million characters were written, and over 0.87 million were removed.
* The code counts **1229 registered changes**; we added over 70 new classes, 220 new methods, 20 new filters, and a shortcode.
* For the main object, `tsf()`, we deleted 19 classes, deprecated 388 methods and 1 property, and deleted 110 methods and 10 properties.
* `uid` is now an accepted custom query parameter for almost all meta-generator methods. If your custom filters for TSF act odd on profile pages, [reach out to us in the forums](https://tsf.fyi/support/tsf/new-topic) and show us your code. **We'll fix it for you.**
* So, if you ever used the `the_seo_framework()` or `tsf()` function, you almost certainly will get a deprecation notice. If you need assistance resolving this, please [open a new support topic](https://tsf.fyi/support/tsf/new-topic) and **show us your code**.

**New meta tag generator**

TSF now generates all meta tags via a registry. You can alter the population of the registry via filters `the_seo_framework_meta_generator_pools` and `the_seo_framework_meta_generators`, and you can modify the final registry via filter `the_seo_framework_meta_render_data`. For that, you can [find an example at Github](https://gist.github.com/sybrew/272b746296114cd93c3320e9544a1618).

**New Schema.org graph generator**

We added a new Schema.org structured data generator to TSF. This generator supports every page, post, archive, and custom post type. We built it to be referential and expansive by generating an ID-based graph. For example, if you refer to a Person once, their entity will be put right there, but if you refer to it again, it will use an ID-based reference. This keeps the output code neat and will not waste time generating an entity twice. You can filter it via `the_seo_framework_schema_graph_data`.

**Environment upgrade notes**

WordPress 5.5 through 5.8 are no longer supported. Here's why:

* [Over 75% of all WordPress sites](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) are using WordPress v5.9 or later.
* Newer versions of WordPress are faster, more reliable, and easier to work with --- for both you and us.
* Supporting past versions takes time away that's better used implementing new features.

PHP 7.2 and 7.3 are no longer supported. Here's why:

* [Almost 80% of all WordPress sites](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) are using PHP v7.4 or later.
* Newer versions of PHP are faster and more secure. For us, they're also easier to work with.
* Again, supporting past versions takes time away that's better used implementing new features.

**Support the development**

We hope you'll love this update as much as we do. Please consider supporting us by sharing [a fantastic review](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription/reviews/#new-topic-0), [get a license](https://theseoframework.com/pricing/), or do your friends and colleagues a favor by installing TSF for them.

**Detailed log**

We become brave by training ourselves to despise and endure terrors, and we shall be best able to endure terrors [when we have become brave](https://theseoframework.com/?p=4135#detailed).
